        By accepting the following terms, you consent to our use and disclosure

      <h1>Information We Collect and Usage</h1>
      <h2>
        When you sign up for a Stable Account, we ask for identifying
        information such as your name, username, email address, and password to
        provide you with a safe, customized, and efficient experience. We use a
        JSON Web Token (JWT)-token for user authentication in our website. The
        JWT-token is a digitally signed JSON object that contains information
        about the user's identity and is used to authenticate the user when they
        log in to our website. The JWT-token is stored in the local storage of
        the user's browser, which allows us to keep the user logged in even
        after they close their browser or leave our website. We take all
        necessary precautions to keep the user data safe and secure, including
        the JWT-token stored in the local storage. Please note that while we
        take all necessary precautions to keep user data safe and secure, there
        is always a risk of unauthorized access or data breaches, and we cannot
        guarantee complete security. As a user, it is your responsibility to
        keep your account and user data safe. We recommend that you do not share
        your device with others, use a secure browser, and do not share your
        account information with others. By using our website, you agree to the
        use of JWT-token for authentication and the storage of the token in the
        local storage of your browser. If you have any questions or concerns
        about the use of the JWT-token or local storage, please contact us.

        account on our website, you acknowledge and agree that your account may
        be deleted at any time without prior notice. We take the privacy of our
