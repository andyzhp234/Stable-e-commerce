## About

I have started this project with the purpose of learning how to develope a Web App that solves real-life problems and fills a need in the business/enterprise space.

I have decided to develop an eCommerce site because I love shopping online, and I am also very interested in learning how to build a website that integrates checkout.

Unlike eCommerce websites like Amazon, eBay, or Walmart, which sells almost everything, this eCommerce web app specializes in selling furniture because I want to focus on a particular industry and make the website one of the best in that industry.

Due to copyright, there aren't many good product images you can find online for free; however, I was able to find many high-quality furniture product images at pexels.com and unsplash.com.

I put a lot of effort into it and I hope that you could like it.

Feel free to try it out! Let me know if you enjoyed it with a ⭐️
